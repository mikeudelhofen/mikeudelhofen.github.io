            This is a brief, extremely condensed version of my life. Since September 12th, 2013, I've been compiling one second of video footage everyday. The project is mostly for me to remember my own day-to-day life - big stuff, little stuff, meaningful stuff, and stupid stuff. Admittedly, it also pushes me to make my day just a little more awesome by inciting "hey, wouldn't it be cool if..." moments, and for the fact that you, the viewer, don't want to see shot after shot of my computer screen.<br/>
            This is all made possible by an awesome app called <a href="http://1secondeveryday.com/">One Second Everyday</a>. Check it out! The app makes it easy to take as much footage as you'd like and still trim it down to 0:01 per day.

            <u>FAQ:</u>
            <br />
            <i>How does this work?</i>
            <br />
            I take some video from my normal phone camera app, 1SE brings up all footage from each day in a neat calendar view, and I select a one-second-long segment of footage for that day. Later, I use the app to compile it all into a single, continuous video.
            <br /><br />
            <i>Have you ever missed a day?</i>
            <br />
            Nope! I'm pretty meticulous about this, so even if today was relatively boring, there's something there.
            <br /><br />
            <i>Is this up to date?</i>
            <br />
            More or less! I try to kick off a new compilation once every couple of weeks or so, then upload to Dropbox and the new version will show up here via the magic of internets.
            <br /><br />
            <i>Why are some of the segments rotated?</i>
            <br />
            AUGH. This is my only gripe about 1SE. Early on in my use of the app, I assumed it would have a way to handle this by rotating the videos or at least zooming to fit to the width of the video player. There's a perpetual entry in their FAQ about it that amounts to "we're hoping to do this eventually".
            <br /><br />
            <i>What happens if I smash my phone? Or if I get a new one? Or both?</i>
            <br />
            Fortunately, I haven't had a chance to test this myself, but 1SE has an option to back up all of your chosen segments to a hidden folder within Google Drive.
            <br /><br />
            <i>When are you going to stop doing this?</i>
            <br />
            Not sure! Never?!
